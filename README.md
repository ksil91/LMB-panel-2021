# LMB-panel-2021

This repository contains code and Jupyter Notebooks detailing the development of a 73 SNP assay from Genotype-by-Sequencing (GBS) data in three largemouth bass lineages (*Micropterus salmoides*, *Micropterus floridanus*), as presented in:

* Silliman K., Zhao H., Justice M., Thongda W., Bowen B., Peatman E. Complex introgression among three diverged largemouth bass lineages. *Evolutionary Applications*, In press. [doi: 10.1111/eva.13314](https://https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/eva.13314)

This repository is intended to facilitate full reproducibility of the paper, as well as demonstrate how to perform a variety of phylogenetic and population genetic analyses on reduced-representation genomic SNP data. Please submit a Github issue if you have any difficulty accessing data or following along with the notebooks.
